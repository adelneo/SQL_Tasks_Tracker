# SQL_Tasks_Tracker
Chat gpt suggested the project
Here's a small project idea that incorporates both Python and SQL:

Project: Task Tracker
Objective:
Create a simple task tracker application that allows users to manage their tasks. The application should use a SQL database for data storage and be accessible through a command-line interface.

Features:

Task Management:

Users can add tasks with details such as task name, description, due date, and status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").
View and Update Tasks:

Users can view a list of their tasks along with their details.
Ability to mark tasks as completed or update their details.
Filtering and Sorting:

Implement options to filter tasks based on status or due date.
Allow sorting tasks based on different criteria.
Database Integration:

Use a SQL database to store task information.
Create tables for tasks with appropriate fields (task_id, task_name, description, due_date, status, etc.).
User Interface:

Implement a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the application.
Use Python's input() function to take user input for adding, updating, or viewing tasks.
Data Validation:

Implement basic data validation to ensure that inputs are in the correct format and within reasonable limits.
Data Persistence:

Ensure that task data is persisted in the SQL database so that users can retrieve their tasks even after restarting the application.
Example Implementation Steps:
Database Setup:

Set up a SQL database (e.g., SQLite) and create a table for tasks.
Python Script:

Write a Python script that connects to the database.
Implement functions for adding, updating, and retrieving tasks from the database.
User Interface:

Develop a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the application.
Display a menu with options for adding, updating, viewing, and filtering tasks.
Testing:

Test the application with various scenarios to ensure correct functionality and error handling.
Documentation:

Provide clear instructions on how to use the application.
Document the database schema and any dependencies.
Optional Enhancements:

Allow users to delete tasks.
Implement a feature to set reminders for upcoming due dates.
Add user authentication for multiple users.
Technologies:
Python: For the application logic and user interface.
SQL Database: For storing task data. You can use SQLite for simplicity.
This project is designed to be simple yet comprehensive enough to cover basic CRUD operations, database integration, and user interaction. Feel free to tailor it to your preferences and add more features based on your skill level and interests.
